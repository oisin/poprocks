Starting point for a simple Asteroids-style browser game using the "Impact":http://impactjs.com/ game engine. Uses the code from the scriptjunkie{} article  "How to Build Asteroids with the Impact HTML5 Game Engine":http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/scriptjunkie/gg189187.aspx . Includes for convenience the Sinatra backend from "chrisdarroch":https://github.com/chrisdarroch/impactrb - run @ruby impact.rb@ to get the server going for the game.

*Note* the Impact game engine is a commercially-licensed piece of software and can't be part of the codebase here.
